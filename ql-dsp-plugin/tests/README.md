# Test folder for QL_DSP Plugin

The ql-dsp-plugin integration directly impacts ql-qlf-plugin testcases 
and testing for ql-dsp function should involve calling synth_quicklogic. 
Therefore this test folder is currently empty and tests will be placed 
under the ql-qlf plugin test folder.

Currently, we're testing the ql_dsp function with :
* the mac_unit test
* the multiplier test
